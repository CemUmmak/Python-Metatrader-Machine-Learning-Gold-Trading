# Python-Metatrader-Machine-Learning-Gold-Trading
A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for Gold trading using Python and MetaTrader 5. This project covers:  ✅ Data Preparation: Automated collection and preprocessing of Gold price data from MetaTrader 5, including feature engineering and label creation. ✅ Model Training: Training machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM) on historical Gold trading data to predict market direction. ✅ Testing on Unseen Data: Evaluation of models on unseen test data to validate performance and robustness. ✅ Live Trading Integration: Deploying the trained models in a live environment using MetaTrader 5 for automated trading execution. ✅ Monitoring & Optimization: Tools for backtesting, tracking live trade performance, and retraining models for continuous improvement.  This pipeline is designed for traders and developers who want to combine Python machine learning with algorithmic Gold trading, going from raw data collection to live trading automation.
